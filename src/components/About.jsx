          I am a software developer with a background in Economics, holding a
          Bachelor’s degree with a focus on Econometrics and Causal Analysis. My
          move into software development was a logical extension of my
          analytical training, applying quantitative thinking, structured
          problem-solving and data-driven reasoning to complex technical
          systems.
          <br />
          <br /> After completing a three-month web development bootcamp and
          intensive self-study, I built a solid foundation in modern web
          technologies. Since March 2025, I have been working as a Junior
          Perfion / Dynamicweb Developer at esyon GmbH in Leipzig. In this role,
          I develop and maintain product data integrations, build custom
          solutions in C# and .NET, and work extensively with SQL Server in
          enterprise environments.
          <br /> <br /> My backend focus is on C# and .NET, designing interfaces
          between systems such as Perfion, Dynamicweb and ERP platforms. I work
          with APIs, data transformations, product data structures and system
          integrations, translating business requirements into stable and
          scalable technical implementations.
          <br /> <br /> My goal is to create seamless, efficient, and scalable
          software solutions that address real-world problems. What drives me is
          not just the technical aspect of development but also the
          collaborative environment that comes with it. I thrive in team
          settings where diverse ideas and perspectives come together to build
          something exceptional. My experiences have taught me the importance of
          clear communication, flexibility, and mutual support in achieving
          project goals.
          <br /> <br /> In addition to my technical skills, I am an avid learner
          and always eager to embrace new challenges. Whether it’s working on
          personal projects or contributing to team initiatives, I am dedicated
          to pushing the boundaries of what I can achieve and bringing value to
          every project I undertake. Feel free to explore my portfolio to see
          some of the projects I’ve worked on and get in touch if you’re
          interested in collaborating or have any questions.
