          With a Bachelor's degree in Economics, focusing on Econometrics and
          Causal Analysis, I developed a strong foundation in data analysis and
          problem-solving. However, my journey took an exciting turn when I
          decided to dive into software development.
          <br />
          <br /> After completing a rigorous three-month web development
          bootcamp and dedicating countless hours to self-study, I’ve become
          proficient in building dynamic websites using React and other
          cutting-edge technologies like Tailwind CSS. As I aim to become a
          top-notch full-stack developer, I continuously seek to expand my skill
          set. I have hands-on experience with backend technologies like
          Node.js, MongoDB, RESTful APIs and i am currently starting to learn
          Java and Spring.
          <br /> <br /> My goal is to create seamless, efficient, and scalable
          web applications that address real-world problems. What drives me is
          not just the technical aspect of development but also the
          collaborative environment that comes with it. I thrive in team
          settings where diverse ideas and perspectives come together to build
          something exceptional. My experiences have taught me the importance of
          clear communication, flexibility, and mutual support in achieving
          project goals.
          <br /> <br /> In addition to my technical skills, I am an avid learner
          and always eager to embrace new challenges. Whether it’s working on
          personal projects or contributing to team initiatives, I am dedicated
          to pushing the boundaries of what I can achieve and bringing value to
          every project I undertake. Feel free to explore my portfolio to see
          some of the projects I’ve worked on and get in touch if you’re
          interested in collaborating or have any questions. I’m excited about
          the opportunity to bring my skills and enthusiasm to your team!
